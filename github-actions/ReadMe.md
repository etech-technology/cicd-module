#  Introduction to GitHub Actions

## 1. What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform built into GitHub**.  
It allows you to **automate workflows** directly from your repository.  

**Use cases include:**
- Running tests on every commit.  
- Building and publishing Docker images.  
- Deploying apps to AWS, Kubernetes, etc.  
- Sending notifications (Slack, Teams, Email).  

Think of it as: *“Every time something happens in GitHub (push, PR, merge), we can automatically run steps/scripts without manual work.”*  

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### Workflow
- A YAML file that defines automation steps.  
- Lives inside `.github/workflows/`.  
- Example: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Events
- Workflows are triggered by **events**.  
- Examples:
  - `push` → when code is pushed.  
  - `pull_request` → when someone opens a PR.  
  - `schedule` → run at specific times (like cron).  
  - `workflow_dispatch` → manual trigger.  

### Jobs
- A workflow is made up of **jobs**.  
- Each job runs on a **runner** (VM or container).  
- Example jobs: `test`, `build`, `deploy`.

### Steps
- Inside jobs, you define **steps**.  
- Steps can:
  - Run commands (`run:`).  
  - Use pre-built actions (`uses:`).  

###  Runners
- The machine that executes your jobs.  
- GitHub provides **hosted runners** (Linux, Windows, macOS).  
- You can also set up **self-hosted runners** for custom environments.

## 3. First Example: Hello World

```yaml
name: Hello World

on: push   # Trigger: whenever code is pushed

jobs:
  say-hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Print message
        run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"
````

Every push will run this workflow and print the message to logs.



## 4. Using Actions

GitHub Actions has a **marketplace** of pre-built actions.
Example: Checkout code with the official action.

```yaml
jobs:
  checkout-example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

* `uses:` = reusing someone’s automation.
* `run:` = writing your own shell commands.

---

## 5. Secrets and Variables

* Store sensitive data (like AWS keys, API tokens) in **GitHub Secrets**.
* Access them inside workflows with `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`.

```yaml
- name: Use secret
  run: echo "My secret is ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}"
```

Never hardcode credentials in YAML. Always use Secrets.

---

## 6. Artifacts

Artifacts let you **store files from one job and use them in another**.
Useful for test reports, Terraform plan, or build outputs.

```yaml
- name: Upload Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: test-results
    path: reports/
```

## 7. How It All Fits Together

✅ **Event**: A push happens
✅ **Workflow**: YAML file defines what to do
✅ **Jobs**: Run on GitHub-hosted runners
✅ **Steps**: Run commands or pre-built actions
✅ **Secrets/Artifacts**: Pass secure data or files between jobs


## 8. Best Practices

* Keep workflows **modular** (separate CI and CD).
* Use **artifacts** to pass outputs between jobs.
* Always test locally before deploying.
* Protect production with **manual approvals** or **branch protections**.

## 9. Discussion Questions

1. Why use GitHub Actions instead of running scripts manually?
2. What’s the difference between `run:` and `uses:`?
3. How would you handle sensitive credentials in pipelines?
4. Can we deploy the same workflow to dev, staging, and prod? How?

---

## Live Demo Idea

1. Create `.github/workflows/hello.yml`.
2. Push to GitHub.
3. Show students how the workflow runs under the **Actions tab**.

Would you like me to also design a **simple diagram (in PNG/SVG)** that visually explains:  
**Event → Workflow → Job → Runner → Steps** so you can embed it in your GitHub repo or slides?
